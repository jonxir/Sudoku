# Sudoku-Solver Generator 

The aim of this project is to create a program in **Python** capable of:
1. Generating a valid Sudoku sheet.
2. Solving it through and algorithm. 

Also the program will have an option to let the user solve a Sudoku and be part of a local ranking (stored in a .txt file) based on how fast he solves the sheet. 


We are open to new ideas and options. Just include them at the bottom of the file! Thanks :)
